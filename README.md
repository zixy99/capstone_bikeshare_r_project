# capstone_bikeshare_r_project

Google Data Analytics final project.

In this project I analyze fictitious rides records for a bicycle ride share company.

The goal is to find ways to convert casual riders to riders who purchase annual membership.

I order to formulate hypothesis of why casual members do not purchase annual members I analyze the data to unearth trends and correlations that distinguish casual riders from member 
ones.  
Once the insights support the hypothesis on why casual riders haven't purchased membership I shall provide 
recommendations on how to affect conversion of casual riders to annual members.

As part of the process I prepare and clean the data and identify dataset limitations that may affect the validity of the hypothesis.

Data for the analysis was downloaded from: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Each of the CSV files in the dataset is zipped in order to keep them from exceeding 100MB. 
Please unzip before trying. 
I may add unzipping operation to the code in the future.

Please share any ideas on how to improve/correct the analysis. Thanks you!
