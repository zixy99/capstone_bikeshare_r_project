# capstone_bikeshare_r_project

Google Data Analytics final project.

In this project we analyze fictitious rides records for a bicycle ride share company.

The goal is to find ways to convert casual riders to riders who purchase annual membership.

The analysis looks for trends and correlations that distinguish casual riders from member 
ones that support hypothesis on why casual riders haven't purchased membership. 
Recommendations based on the findings for way to affect the conversion are suggested.

Data for the analysis was downloaded from: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

All CSV files in the dataset are zipped in order to keep them from exceeding 100MB. 
Please unzip before trying.
